<pre>1. Introduction to Distributed Systems
Definition:



A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single, coherent system.

Hardware or software components communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.

Each node is a complete computer with its own peripherals, and nodes may run different operating systems.
Coupling:

These systems are "loosely coupled" (more so than multicomputers).

Strength: Computers can be used for a wide variety of applications.

Weakness: Programming is difficult due to the lack of a common underlying model.


2. Significant Challenges
There are three major consequences of being distributed:



Concurrency: Different computers can execute programs at the same time, sharing resources like files. coordinating these programs is a recurring issue.

No Global Clock: Computers can't synchronize their clocks accurately, so programs coordinate by exchanging messages rather than time. Clock drift rates (deviation from a perfect reference clock) differ between computers.

Independent Failures: A system can fail in new ways. For example, a network fault might isolate a computer that is otherwise still working, but other components might not be able to detect if it has failed or is just slow. Components can fail independently.


3. System Models: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
Synchronous Distributed Systems:
These are systems where strict bounds (limits) are defined:



Process Speed: Time to execute a step has known lower and upper bounds.

Message Delay: Messages are received within a known bounded time.

Clock Drift: Local clocks drift from real time within a known bound.

Advantage: You can use timeouts to detect process failures.
Asynchronous Distributed Systems (e.g., The Internet):

No Bounds: There are no limits on process execution speeds, message transmission delays, or clock drift rates.

Implication: You cannot guarantee how long a file transfer will take.

Limitations: Some problems (like multimedia streaming requiring strict deadlines) cannot be solved in an asynchronous system.


4. Grid vs. Cluster Computing
Grid Computing:


Definition: A distributed system that connects multiple (often geographically dispersed) computers to work as a virtual supercomputer.

Key Features:

Resource Sharing: Combines storage and power across machines.

Heterogeneous: Different hardware, OS, and networks.

Decentralized: No single authority; different organizations own different parts.

Scalable: Easy to add more computers.
Cluster Computing:


Definition: A group of interconnected computers (nodes) working together as a single unified system, usually in the same location.

Key Features:

Tightly Coupled: Connected via high-speed local networks (LAN).

Homogeneous: Similar hardware and OS.

Single Administration: Managed by on organization.

High Availability: If one node fails, others take over.
Types of Clusters:


High-Performance Computing (HPC): Used for scientific simulations and AI (supercomputing).

High-Availability (HA): Ensures uptime for critical systems like banking.

Load Balancing: Distributes workload across servers (e.g., web servers) to optimize performance.


5. Event Ordering
Since there is no global clock, we order events based on "Logical Time".
The Happened-Before Relation (\rightarrow):
Lamport defined this relation to capture causal precedence:



HB1 (Same Process): If event a happens before b in the same process, then a \rightarrow b.

HB2 (Messages): The event of sending a message (send(m)) always happens before receiving it (receive(m)).

HB3 (Transitivity): If a \rightarrow b and b \rightarrow c, then a \rightarrow c.
Concurrency:

Two events are concurrent (a || e) if neither caused the other (no path of messages between them).

They might happen at different physical times, but logically they are concurrent because they don't affect each other.


6. Logical Clocks (Lamport Clocks)
A software counter (L_i) maintained by each process to timestamp events.
Rules:



LC1 (Internal): Before any event, increment the counter: L_i := L_i + 1.

LC2 (Communication):

Sender piggybacks its timestamp t = L_i on the message.

Receiver updates its clock: L_j := \max(L_j, t) + 1.
Limitation:


If a \rightarrow b, then L(a) &lt; L(b).

However, if L(a) &lt; L(b), we cannot infer that a \rightarrow b. They might be concurrent.


7. Vector Clocks
Developed to solve the limitation of Lamport clocks. Each process maintains an array of N integers (where N is the number of processes).
Rules:



VC1 (Init): Initialize all values to 0.

VC2 (Event): Before tagging an event, process P_i increments its own index: V_i[i] := V_i[i] + 1.

VC3 (Send): Include the vector V in the message.

VC4 (Receive): Upon receiving a vector t, update the local vector: V_i[j] := \max(V_i[j], t[j]) for all j.
Advantage:

We can compare timestamps to determine causality. V(a) &lt; V(b) if and only if a \rightarrow b.

We can detect concurrent events by inspecting timestamps.

Disadvantage: Requires storage and message payload proportional to N.


8. Communication Models



FIFO (First-In, First-Out): Messages form a queue; order is preserved per channel.

Non-FIFO: Messages can be received in random order.

Causal Ordering (CO): Based on the happened-before relation. If sending m_1 caused sending m_2, then m_1 must be received before m_2. This implies FIFO.

Significance: Simplifies distributed algorithm design (e.g., database updates) by providing built-in synchronization.



9. Global State & Snapshots
Global State: The collection of local states of all processes plus the state of all communication channels (messages in transit).
Consistent vs. Inconsistent:



Consistent State: If a message is recorded as "received", it must also be recorded as "sent". An effect cannot exist without a cause.

Inconsistent State: A message is seen as received but not sent (impossible in reality, but can happen in a bad snapshot).

Cuts: A "cut" is a line drawn across the timeline. A consistent cut does not capture any messages traveling from the future back to the past.


10. Chandy-Lamport Snapshot Algorithm
An algorithm to record a consistent global state in a system with FIFO channels.
The "Marker" Message:
A special control message used to separate messages to be included in the snapshot from those that shouldn't.
Rules:



Marker Sending Rule:

Process records its state.

Immediately sends a marker on all outgoing channels before sending any other messages.


Marker Receiving Rule:

If a process receives a marker and hasn't recorded its state yet: Record state, mark channel as empty, and send markers out.

If it has already recorded its state: Record the state of that channel (all messages received since the state recording up to this marker).</pre>
